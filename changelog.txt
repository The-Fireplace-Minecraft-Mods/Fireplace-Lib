Overhauled config GUI building
- creating options is now more flexible and convenient, no more overloaded functions to set settings
- dependencies are more convenient to add, no more tracking translations and categories
- added subcategory support
- added the ability to have a button entry in the Config GUI open a custom screen which can be used to build a new value. Currently only supports Strings.
